## PseudoRandomClient
Local Code for the PseudoRandom project.

* Download ZIP.
* Launch any HTML file.
* Enjoy.

#### Note: 
 * Local Storage there will not work, nor will any of the Server-based functionality.
 * There is no theoretical need for an internet connection to have this running (Google Fonts won't work, bo-hoo. )
