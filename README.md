## PseudoRandomClient
Local Code for the PseudoRandom project. https://pseudorandom.glitch.me/

* Download ZIP.
* Launch any HTML file.
* Enjoy.

#### Note: 
 * Local Storage there will most likely not be persistent reliably.
 * Server-side features on the hosted app is not represented here, for ease of development. (Server features are still experimental)
 * There is no theoretical need for an internet connection to have this running (Google Fonts won't work, bo-hoo. )
